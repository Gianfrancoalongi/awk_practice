awk_practice
============

This repository contains an automated exercise system aimed at helping
people get into awk by solving specific problems, but at the same time 
getting acquainted with the excellent AWK Manual.

Every scenario is self contained and self-verifying within the scripts 
called scenario_X.bash

You simply bash the scenario script, read the output, and do what is 
requested. Then you verify your result as shown by the script.

The scenario output will direct you to the AWK manual[1] and what chapters
are necessary in order to succeed with the task.
